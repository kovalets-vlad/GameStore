# 🎮 GameStore — Django Project

This is my first Django project — a simple web application for an online game store. It includes a custom-built admin panel, CRUD functionality, and visualizations such as charts and statistics.

## 📌 Features

- 🔐 User authentication and authorization
- 📊 Data visualization with charts
- 🧩 Full CRUD operations for games, genres, platforms, and publishers
- 🛍️ Game browsing by category
- ⚙️ Custom admin panel (not using the default Django Admin)
- 🧠 Relational data structure (games linked to genres, platforms, and publishers)

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Django
- MySQL
- HTML & CSS

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
